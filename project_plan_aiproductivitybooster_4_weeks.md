# AIProductivityBooster.com: Detailed Project Plan (4 Weeks)

## 1. Project Overview & Goals

**Project:** Design and develop a professional, high-converting affiliate marketing website for AIProductivityBooster.com.
**Goal:** To deliver a fully functional, modern, and conversion-optimized website based on the provided 8-phase Website Development Checklist, within a 4-week timeframe. The website will promote AI-related productivity tools and services, aiming to be best-in-class.
**Key Pillars:** User Experience (UX), Conversion Optimization, Modern Design, Technical Excellence, and a robust Content Strategy.

## 2. Roles & Responsibilities

*   **Pete Armstrong (User):** Project Owner. Provides overall direction, specific content details (e.g., affiliate links, final text for About/Privacy if placeholders are insufficient), branding assets (e.g., final logo if developed), feedback, and approvals. Responsible for providing any external credentials (e.g., analytics) as identified.
*   **Manus (AI Agent):** Expert Project Manager & Web Development Assistant. Responsible for task organization, prioritization, timeline management, execution of development and design tasks, drafting placeholder content, creating mockups/samples, comprehensive documentation (project log, style guide, reports), and proactive communication.

## 3. Communication & Reporting Plan

*   **End-of-Day Updates (Brief):** Summary of tasks completed, progress made, any issues encountered, and tasks planned for the next day.
*   **Weekly Milestone Reviews (Detailed):** At the end of each week, a review of milestone achievement, deliverables for that week, and a look ahead. This will be a key point for user feedback and approval.
*   **Ad-hoc Clarifications:** I will flag any tasks requiring your input or clarification as they arise to ensure smooth progress, as per your instructions.
*   **Project Log:** The `todo.md` file (which I will create based on your checklist and update) will serve as a dynamic project log, tracking completed and pending tasks. This will be supplemented by our communications.

## 4. Task Organization & Prioritization Strategy

Tasks from the 8-phase checklist will be grouped and prioritized as follows:
*   **Phase 1 (Foundation):** Complete first, as it sets up the entire structure.
*   **Phase 4 (Design - Initial):** Define color scheme and typography early in Week 1 to guide visual development.
*   **Phase 2 (UX/UI) & Phase 6 (Content - Basic Pages):** Develop core pages and their UX/UI concurrently.
*   **Phase 3 (Conversion Optimization):** Integrate these elements once core pages and UX are established.
*   **Phase 5 (Technical Excellence - SEO, Performance):** Implement throughout, with a focus in later stages for optimization.
*   **Phase 6 (Content - Strategy & Advanced):** Develop content structures and advanced lead capture after basic pages are done.
*   **Phase 4 (Design - Visuals & Micro-interactions):** Layer these in once the core structure and UX are solid.
*   **Phase 7 (Benchmarking & Innovation):** Address these conceptual tasks towards the end.
*   **Phase 8 (Deliverables):** Compile documentation and reports in the final week.
