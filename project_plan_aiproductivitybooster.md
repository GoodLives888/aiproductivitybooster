# AIProductivityBooster.com: Project Plan & Timeline

## 1. Project Overview & Goals

**Project:** Design and develop a professional, high-converting affiliate marketing website for AIProductivityBooster.com.
**Goal:** To deliver a fully functional, modern, and conversion-optimized website based on the provided Website Development Checklist, within a 4-week timeframe. The website will promote AI-related productivity tools and services, aiming to be best-in-class.
**Key Pillars:** User Experience (UX), Conversion Optimization, Modern Design, Technical Excellence, and a robust Content Strategy.

## 2. Roles & Responsibilities

*   **Pete Armstrong (User):** Project Owner. Provides overall direction, content specifics, affiliate details, feedback, and approvals. Responsible for providing any external assets or credentials as identified.
*   **Manus (AI Agent):** Project Manager & Web Development Assistant. Responsible for task organization, prioritization, timeline management, execution of development and design tasks, content drafting (placeholders), documentation, reporting, and proactive communication.

## 3. Communication Plan

*   **Daily Updates (End of Day):** Brief summary of tasks completed, progress made, and any immediate blockers.
*   **Weekly Milestone Reviews:** At the end of each week, a more detailed review of milestone achievement, deliverables for that week, and a look ahead to the next week. This will be an opportunity for your feedback and approval before proceeding.
*   **Ad-hoc Clarifications:** I will flag any tasks requiring your input or clarification as they arise to ensure smooth progress.
*   **Project Log:** The `todo.md` file within the project will be continuously updated to reflect task status. This, along with our communications, will serve as the project log.

## 4. Task Organization & Prioritization Strategy

Tasks from the 8-phase checklist have been grouped and prioritized to optimize workflow, address dependencies, and ensure a logical progression from foundational elements to advanced features and final deliverables. The general approach is:
1.  **Foundation First:** Establish site structure, branding, and basic page shells.
2.  **Core UX/UI:** Develop the user interface, navigation, and responsiveness.
3.  **Conversion Elements:** Integrate CTA strategies, persuasive design, and affiliate marketing features.
4.  **Content & SEO:** Structure and populate content areas, implement SEO best practices.
5.  **Technical Polish:** Optimize for performance, ensure compatibility and accessibility.
6.  **Advanced Concepts:** Plan for future innovations.
7.  **Final Deliverables:** Compile documentation and prepare for deployment.

Design elements (Phase 4) will be integrated throughout the development phases rather than being a standalone block. Content tasks (Phase 6) will also be interwoven starting from Week 1.

## 5. Project Timeline (4 Weeks)

**Overall Duration:** 4 Weeks

### Week 1: Project Kick-off & Foundational Build (Days 1-5)
*   **Milestone:** Basic site architecture, core branding elements, and essential pages (Home, About, Contact, Privacy, Blog shell) established with placeholder content. Initial design direction (colors, fonts) defined.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Day 1:** Finalize this project plan, refine task details, and confirm initial user input questions.
    *   **Day 1-2 (Phase 1):** Define overall site structure: Implement reusable Header, Footer, and Navigation components. Design main content area layout.
    *   **Day 2-3 (Phase 1):** Set up basic branding: Integrate Site Title (AIProductivityBooster.com), Email (admin@aiproductivitybooster.com), Contact (Pete Armstrong) into relevant areas (e.g., footer, contact page).
        *   **USER INPUT 1 (Branding):** Do you have a logo for AIProductivityBooster.com? If so, please provide it. If not, shall I create a text-based placeholder or a simple graphic placeholder for now?
    *   **Day 3-4 (Phase 1 & 6):** Create basic page structures (React components) for Home, About, Contact, Privacy Policy, and a shell for the Blog section. Populate About and Privacy Policy pages with professionally drafted placeholder content.
    *   **Day 4-5 (Phase 4):** Define a clean, professional color scheme (tech-inspired blues, whites, accents) and select bold, readable typography. I will propose specific hex codes and font families for your review.
        *   **USER INPUT 2 (Design Approval):** I will present color palette and typography suggestions for your approval.

### Week 2: Core UX/UI Development & Feature Integration (Days 6-10)
*   **Milestone:** Key pages are interactive, fully responsive across devices, and visually aligned with the approved branding. Initial CTA placements are integrated.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Day 6-7 (Phase 2):** Design and implement an intuitive, user-friendly interface with seamless navigation based on Week 1 structures. Ensure the site is fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile).
    *   **Day 7-8 (Phase 2):** Implement sticky call-to-action (CTA) buttons. Implement hover effects for interactive elements and initial smooth animations for transitions.
    *   **Day 8-9 (Phase 2 & 4):** Implement dynamic content placeholder (e.g., a product carousel on the homepage with placeholder items). Incorporate AI-themed graphics/icons (placeholders or generated samples if feasible).
        *   **USER INPUT 3 (Featured Content):** For the product carousel, are there any specific types of AI tools or categories you envision featuring initially?
    *   **Day 9-10 (Phase 4):** Implement minimalist layouts and begin incorporating micro-interactions to enhance the premium feel.

### Week 3: Conversion Optimization & Content Strategy (Days 11-15)
*   **Milestone:** Key conversion optimization elements are designed and integrated. Structures for primary value-driven content (reviews, guides, blog) are in place. Lead capture mechanism designed.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Day 11-12 (Phase 3):** Strategically place affiliate links and CTAs (using placeholders for now) in high-visibility areas. Use persuasive copywriting for these CTAs (drafts). Design comparison tables, product review templates, and detailed guide templates.
        *   **USER INPUT 4 (Affiliate Links):** Could you provide 2-3 example affiliate links or product types you intend to promote? This will help in designing effective CTA placements.
    *   **Day 12-13 (Phase 3):** Implement placeholder examples for psychological triggers (e.g., "Limited Offer" banners, countdown timer concept) and social proof elements (e.g., testimonial section mockups, user rating display concept).
    *   **Day 13-14 (Phase 6):** Develop the structure for engaging, value-driven content (e.g., layout for "Top 10 AI Tools," "How AI Can Boost Your Workflow"). Implement a functional contact form. Create a lead capture system structure (e.g., email opt-in form with a placeholder for a free guide offer).
        *   **USER INPUT 5 (Lead Magnet):** For the email opt-in, what is the intended free guide or offer? (e.g., "Top 5 AI Productivity Hacks Ebook"). I can design the form and placeholder for the guide.
    *   **Day 14-15 (Phase 5):** Implement SEO best practices: Keyword-optimized content structure (placeholders in page templates), meta tags for main pages, alt text guidelines for images. Plan for integration of analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics) and affiliate tracking systems (i.e., ensure code structure allows easy insertion later).

### Week 4: Finalization, Technical Polish & Deliverables (Days 16-20)
*   **Milestone:** Website is feature-complete according to the initial scope, technically sound, optimized, and all project deliverables (style guide, reports, deployment-ready code) are prepared.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Day 16-17 (Phase 2, 4, 5):** Finalize and polish all micro-interactions and animations. Optimize for fast loading speeds (image compression strategy, lazy loading implementation). Ensure compatibility with major browsers (testing).
    *   **Day 17-18 (Phase 5):** Ensure compliance with accessibility standards (WCAG guidelines review and implementation where applicable).
    *   **Day 18-19 (Phase 7):** Develop detailed conceptual plans/mockups for AI-driven product recommendations and a chatbot to guide users, as these are marked for future consideration.
    *   **Day 19-20 (Phase 8):** Create the Style Guide document (fonts, colors, design principles). Prepare the report explaining design and development choices. Ensure the website is ready for Netlify deployment (build process tested, deployment guide confirmed).
    *   **Day 20:** Final internal review. Package all deliverables for user handoff.
        *   **USER INPUT 6 (Final Review & Credentials):** Your final review of the complete website. If you wish for me to attempt analytics integration, please provide Google Analytics Tracking ID or similar.
